# Apache Hive Web Log Analysis Project
Web Log Analysis using Apache Hive on Apache Zeppelin
Project Overview
This project showcases a complete data analytics solution for analyzing Apache web server logs. Using big data technologies, I transformed raw, unstructured log files into meaningful business insights through interactive dashboards and automated reporting.
üéØ The Challenge
Our organization needed to understand website traffic patterns, user behavior, and identify potential issues from massive Apache web server logs. The challenge was processing large volumes of unstructured data stored across distributed systems and making it accessible for real-time analysis.
üí° My Solution
I designed and built an end-to-end analytics pipeline that:

Processes large-scale log data from distributed storage (HDFS)
Transforms unstructured logs into organized, queryable data
Provides interactive dashboards for real-time insights
Delivers actionable analytics for business and technical teams

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Approach
Environment & Infrastructure

Set up Apache Zeppelin in a Linux environment (WSL2) for interactive data analysis
Configured Hive JDBC connections with proper dependencies and networking
Established Windows-to-Linux port forwarding for seamless browser access
Integrated with Hadoop ecosystem for distributed data processing

Data Processing Pipeline

Data Ingestion: Collected and stored web logs in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
Data Parsing: Used advanced regular expressions to convert unstructured log entries into structured database tables
Schema Design: Created organized data tables with fields like host, timestamp, request type, status codes, and response sizes
Data Loading: Automated the process of loading log files into the analytics system

Analytics & Insights
Built comprehensive analysis covering:

Traffic Patterns: Who visits the website and when
Popular Content: Most and least accessed web pages
Error Tracking: Identification of broken links and server errors
Performance Monitoring: Response times and server load analysis
Time-based Trends: Traffic distribution across different time periods

üèÜ Key Achievements
Business Impact

Identified Top Traffic Sources: Discovered which visitors generate the most activity
Found Critical Issues: Located broken links causing 404 errors that needed immediate fixing
Optimized Resource Allocation: Determined which web pages drive the most engagement
Established Performance Baselines: Created metrics for ongoing website monitoring

Technical Success

Scalable Solution: Built a system capable of handling large datasets efficiently
Real-time Analytics: Enabled instant querying and visualization of log data
Interactive Dashboards: Created user-friendly interfaces for non-technical stakeholders
Automated Processing: Streamlined the entire workflow from raw logs to insights
